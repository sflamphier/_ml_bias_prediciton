# _ml_bias_prediciton
I have only trained this model on 198 data points making the accuracy pretty rough. My hope for this program is to allow people to determine if a trusted news source is consistently producing "0" or biased content. Hopefully resulting in users looking for less biased sources to form more educated and well-rounded beliefs/opinions.
